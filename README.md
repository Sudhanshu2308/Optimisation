# Optimisation
This project focuses on developing a Customized Tourist Itinerary Recommender System using the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW). The system generates optimal travel routes for tourists, ensuring visits to attractions are scheduled within predefined time windows.
Features
Data Collection: Compiled a comprehensive dataset of tourist destinations across 26 states and 4 union territories through web scraping of commercial websites.
Optimization: Applied CVRPTW to determine the most efficient routes while considering time and capacity constraints.
Visualization: Utilized the Folium library to create interactive maps, showcasing optimal routes and itineraries.
Tech Stack
Python (Optimization Libraries and Web Scraping)
Folium (Interactive Map Visualization)
Applications
This system helps travelers plan efficient itineraries, ensuring they visit desired locations within operating hours while minimizing travel time.
